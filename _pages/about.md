As a PhD student at the University of Twente, I am specializing in computer vision under the guidance of Raymond Veldhuis, Christoph Brune, and Nicola Strisciuglio. My research is centered on improving the robustness of deep learning-based computer vision systems against common image degradations such as noise and blur. Additionally, I work on cell segmentation and classification provided by the BIOS lab at the University of Twente.

My research interests include robustness, generalization, efficient learning (from both model and data perspectives), and large-language model.
